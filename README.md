# Implementation-of-Decision-Tree-Regressor-Model-for-Predicting-the-Salary-of-the-Employee

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the Decision Tree Regressor Model for Predicting the Salary of the Employee.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
### Step-1:
Import the required libraries .
### Step-2:
Read the data frame using pandas.
### Step-3:
Get the information regarding the null values present in the dataframe.
### Step-4:
Apply label encoder to the non-numerical column inoreder to convert into numerical values.
### Step-5:
Determine training and test data set.
### Step-6:
Apply decision tree regression on to the dataframe.
### Step-7:
Get the values of Mean square error, r2 and data prediction.
